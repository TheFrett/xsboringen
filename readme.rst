XSBoringen
==========
Is a python library for processing and plotting borehole and CPT data, developed for open data formats in the Netherlands.
The library contains a command line interface called ``xsb``, for exporting borehole data can be exported to CSV or shapefile and plotting 2D cross-sections. The following input formats are supported:

- Dinoloket XML 1.4 (boreholes only)
- Dinoloket GEF (boreholes and CPT's)
- CSV (boreholes only)

For the cross-sections additional data can be read from raster or shapefiles. The library was tested and developed on Windows.

Installation
------------

XSboringen requires Python 3.0 or higher, and has the following dependencies:

- click
- pyyaml
- numpy
- matplotlib
- gdal
- fiona
- rasterio
- shapely
- xarray

The packages click, pyyaml, numpy and matplotlib can be installed using pip or conda without problems.
The others can be succesfully installed using conda-forge or by using pip with prebuild wheels (see Christoph Gohlke's website). It is recommended to install gdal before fiona and rasterio are installed.

Usage
-----
The command line interface contains the following commands.

write_csv
~~~~~~~~~

Read borehole and CPT datasources and export to CSV table.

::

    xsb write_csv write_csv.yaml

write_csv.yaml file contains references to the input datasources and the output file. See the examples folder.

write_shape
~~~~~~~~~~~

Read borehole and CPT datasources and export to shapefile.

::

    xsb write_shape write_shape.yaml

write_shape.yaml file contains references to the input datasources and the output file. See the examples folder.

plot
~~~~
Read borehole and CPT datasources and plot to 2D cross-sections based on a polyline shapefile.

::

    xsb plot plot.yaml

plot.yaml file contains references to the input datasources and the output folder. See the examples folder.
